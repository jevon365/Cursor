# Circus Maximus - Game Development Rules

## General Guidelines
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Use clear variable and function names
- Comment complex game logic
- Follow best practices for vanilla JavaScript
- Prioritize playability and shareability

## Code Style
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes)
- Prefer composition over inheritance where applicable
- Optimize for performance in game loops
- Use ES6+ features (const/let, arrow functions, classes, modules)

## Project Structure
- Organize code by feature/component (game/, ai/, ui/, utils/)
- Separate game logic from rendering
- Keep all game numbers in config.js for easy balance tweaking
- Maintain clear separation between phases, mechanics, and UI

## Game-Specific Guidelines
- All numeric values must be in config.js, not hardcoded
- Game state must be serializable for save/load
- Support 2-4 players
- Handle all phases and win conditions
- AI must be phase-aware and win-condition aware
- Error handling should provide clear feedback to players

## Testing
- Test game mechanics thoroughly
- Consider edge cases in gameplay
- Test with different player counts
- Verify all win conditions work correctly
- Document known bugs or limitations

## MVP Focus
- Functional over beautiful - get game working first
- Clear instructions for non-tech users
- Robust error handling
- Save/load functionality
- AI that can complete games
