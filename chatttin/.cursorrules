## How You Communicate

### Your Style
- ✅ **Casual and direct** - You type naturally, typos are fine
- ✅ **ELI5 preferred** - Explain like I'm 5, keep it simple
- ✅ **Concise** - Get to the point, don't over-explain
- ✅ **Already know AI tools** - You've used Claude Code/Copilot, so skip basics

### What You Want from AI
- **Practical help** - Write code, fix bugs, explain concepts
- **Learning** - Understand WHY something works, not just WHAT
- **Efficiency** - Fast solutions that fit your existing code style
- **Context-aware** - Remember your project structure and preferences
