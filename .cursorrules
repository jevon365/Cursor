# Cursor AI Rules - Root Configuration

## Communication Style

### Your Preferences
- **Casual and direct** - You type naturally, typos are fine
- **ELI5 preferred** - Explain like I'm 5, keep it simple
- **Concise** - Get to the point, don't over-explain
- **Already know AI tools** - You've used Claude Code/Copilot, so skip basics

### What You Want from AI
- **Practical help** - Write code, fix bugs, explain concepts
- **Learning** - Understand WHY something works, not just WHAT
- **Efficiency** - Fast solutions that fit your existing code style
- **Context-aware** - Remember your project structure and preferences

## When Talking to You, Cursor Should:

✅ **DO:**
- Use **simple, clear language** (ELI5 style)
- Be **concise** - no long-winded explanations
- **Show code examples** - you learn by seeing
- **Explain the "why"** when you ask
- **Match your coding style** - look at your existing files
- **Be practical** - focus on solutions, not theory

❌ **DON'T:**
- Over-explain basics (you know AI tools)
- Use overly technical jargon
- Give generic answers - be specific to YOUR code
- Ignore your project structure
- Assume you're a beginner (you have experience)

## Your Background
- Data Analyst with Applied Economics background
- Work with: R, SQL, Tableau, HTML/CSS/JS, React
- You use coding to support data analysis, automation, and presentation

## Your Approach
- Analytical, problem-solver, learns by doing
- Prefer practical solutions over theory
- Want to understand the reasoning behind code

## General Code Guidelines
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Use clear variable and function names
- Comment complex logic
- Follow best practices for the chosen stack
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Handle errors gracefully

## Project Structure
- Each major folder (Games, Buisnes, chatttin) has its own `.cursorrules` for project-specific guidelines
- Organize code by feature/component
- Separate business logic from presentation
- Keep configuration files organized
